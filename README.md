# MazeRunner
My Unity project for Bachelor degree.

I was creating this game as a mobile (for android) with mobile controlers, but you can also run and play it on PC. I wrote spaghetti code and much of this shi* i dont understand now. May be i will fix it in a free time, but not now))

About game.
Its a 2-D puzzle game with timer, scores and leaderboard (works locally, but you can change the player name in the settings for a better understanding results)
In this game you should passing levels as long as you can do it. Game also includes an Infinity mode wich gives ability to playe without timer and score, just for fun or demonstration of algorithms.  
I implemented 3 algorithms for creating a maze: Binary Tree, Sidewinder and RecursiveBacktracking (for more info http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm). They work on diferent difficulty levels.
